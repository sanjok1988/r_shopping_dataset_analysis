# Introduction
The objective of this report is to analyze time-series customer shopping or sales data obtained from a certain shopping mall. The dataset, available in an Excel file, comprises various attributes such as invoice number, customer ID, gender, age, category, quantity, price, payment method, and invoice date. The sales quantity serves as the output variable (y), while other values act as input variables (x). It is assumed that the dataset is affected by additional noise, which is independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise with a mean of zero.
The initial phase involves exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This includes: Time series plots of input and output customer shopping data, distribution analysis of each sales data, correlation and scatter plots between different input customer data and the output sales quantity to examine their dependencies.
In the second phase, our aim is to find a good math formula that explains how the input stuff relates to the sales we see. We try out five different formulas and see which one works best, looking at things like AIC, BIC, and how the errors are spread out. Then, we use a fancy method called Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to figure out the details of the formula we picked. This involves setting some starting guesses, drawing some random guesses, and then checking how well they match up with our data. Finally, we look at the results in graphs to understand them better.
